## ü§ù Development Standards and Process

### Code Quality Standards ‚úÖ **ESTABLISHED**
- **Confirmation Process**: All tasks confirmed before implementation
- **Incremental Development**: Work in small, manageable steps
- **Line-by-Line Modifications**: Show specific changes, not full files
- **Component Extraction**: Proactive refactoring for reusability
- **Continuous Quality**: Maintain best practices throughout

### Architecture Principles ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Vue 3**: `<script setup>` syntax with Composition API
- **Comments**: English language in all source code
- **SCSS + BEM**: `.block__element--modifier` methodology
- **Media Queries**: Within BEM blocks using breakpoint variables
- **Mobile-First**: 480px primary target with progressive enhancement
- **Store Architecture**: Pinia with reactive state management
- **Component Modularity**: Reusable and testable components

### Collaboration Workflow ‚úÖ **OPTIMIZED**
1. **Task Planning**: Clear objectives and confirmation before work
2. **Incremental Development**: Small steps with continuous feedback
3. **Documentation**: Keep all documentation current and comprehensive
